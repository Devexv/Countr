# Countr

Countr - Console Counter Program

Description:
Countr is a simple console program written in C++ that allows users to count numbers using three buttons: add (+1), subtract (-1), and stop (prints the current count and exits the program).

Usage:
1. Run the compiled executable file (Countr.exe).
2. Follow the prompts to choose options:
   - Press '1' to add 1 to the count.
   - Press '2' to subtract 1 from the count.
   - Press '3' to stop counting and print the final count.
3. After choosing '3', the program will print the final count and exit.

Compilation:
To compile the program, you can use a C++ compiler like g++:

```cpp
g++ Countr.cpp -o Countr
```

Replace "Countr.cpp" with the filename of your source code if necessary.

Requirements:
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Terminal or Command Prompt to run the program
